This project aims to build a Tesla coil, a type of resonant transformer circuit invented by Nikola Tesla in the late 19th century, which can generate high voltage, low current electricity.

### What is a Tesla Coil?
A Tesla coil is an electrical resonant transformer circuit used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high-frequency alternating-current electricity. It consists of two main components: a primary coil and a secondary coil, each with its own capacitor. The primary coil is connected to a power source and is used to create a magnetic field, which induces a current in the secondary coil. This causes the secondary coil to resonate at its own frequency, generating a high-voltage, low-current output.

### Objective
The main objective of this project is to understand the working principle of a Tesla coil and demonstrate its ability to generate high voltage electricity. This project is designed for Class 12 CBSE Boards Physics students, and it is intended to provide them with hands-on experience in building and testing a practical electrical circuit.

### Materials Required
1. Copper wire
2. PVC pipe
3. Capacitors
4. Spark gap
5. Power source
6. Oscilloscope
7. Multimeter

### Building the Tesla Coil
The Tesla coil can be built in several steps. The primary and secondary coils are wound around a PVC pipe, with the primary coil consisting of fewer turns of thicker copper wire, and the secondary coil consisting of more turns of thinner wire. Capacitors are connected to each coil to create a resonant circuit. A spark gap is used to discharge the high voltage generated by the Tesla coil, creating a spectacular visual display of electric sparks.

### Testing and Troubleshooting
To test the Tesla coil, an oscilloscope and a multimeter can be used to measure the frequency and voltage of the output. Troubleshooting may be necessary to ensure that the circuit is working properly and that there are no shorts or other problems that could cause damage to the circuit or the user.

### Conclusion
By building a Tesla coil for their Class 12 CBSE Boards Physics project, students can gain a deeper understanding of electrical circuits and learn how to build and test practical electronic devices. This project is an excellent way to develop hands-on skills in electrical engineering and to prepare for future studies and careers in this field.
